# roblosploit

roblosploit is a free and open source cybersecurity toolkit for roblox games.

It is a plugin-based program where the default software is essentially just a loader, allowing you to add in the plugins that you require to get the job done.

The loader is licensed with GPL3, meaning that if you make changes to the loader and intend to redistribute these changes you are required to use the GPL3 license with them, and make the source code available to the public. If you don’t plan to redistribute but would still like to help contribute you can make your changes public too!

The plugins I create will be licensed with GPL3, meaning the same thing, if you make changes and are planning to distribute you will have to post the source code to the public. For plugins you create yourself, make the code whatever license you want! It’s your code and you should have the right to redistribute however you want.

If you’d like to help you can check the issues tab and fix any bugs that may be present, and if you find a bug please do report it! Feature requests can also be put in there as well.

If you use roblosploit in a project you DO NOT have to publish your entire source code! You only need to publish changes you make to roblosploit if you intend to distrubte roblosploit!
